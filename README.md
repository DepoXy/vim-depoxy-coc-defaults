# vim-depoxy-coc-defaults

- `gr` ‚Äî Calls `coc-references`

## INSTALL

Installation is easy using Vim's packages feature (see ``:help packages``).

If you want the plugin to load automatically on Vim startup,
use a ``start/`` directory, e.g.,

  ```shell
  mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/landonb/start
  ```

And then clone the project to that path:

  ```shell
  cd ~/.vim/pack/landonb/start
  git clone https://github.com/landonb/vim-depoxy-coc-defaults.git
  ```

If you want to test the package first, make it optional instead
(see ``:help pack-add``):

  ```shell
  mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/landonb/opt
  cd ~/.vim/pack/landonb/opt
  git clone https://github.com/landonb/vim-depoxy-coc-defaults.git

  " When ready, load the [opt]ional plugin (or is it [opt]-in?).
  :packadd! vim-depoxy-coc-defaults
  ```

To build the help, ensure the plugin is loaded, and then
run the following command just one time from within Vim:

  ```shell
  :Helptags
  ```

Or, you can build the help from the terminal instead. Run:

  ```shell
  vim -u NONE -c "helptags vim-depoxy-coc-defaults/doc" -c q
  ```

And then to view the help from within Vim, run:

  ```shell
  :help vim-depoxy-coc-defaults
  ```
